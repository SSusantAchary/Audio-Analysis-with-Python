This is a hands on series for Audio Analysis. Basic audio data consists of sounds and noises.
Human speech is a special case of that. we will work through various aspects like digitize sound,
process audio data, convert audio to spectrograms, MFCC, Audio Augmentations, more.

## Applications of üîä
- Sound/Audio classification
- Speech to Text (STT)
- Automatic Speech Recognition
- Speech Transcription
